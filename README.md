# Facial Health Analyzer 🏥💻  
_A real-time facial health assessment tool using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and AI._

---

## 📌 Overview
Facial Health Analyzer is a Python-based application that detects various facial health indicators, including:

✅ **Pimples & Skin Redness** – Analyzes skin conditions using image processing  
✅ **Eye Droopiness** – Identifies tiredness and potential drowsiness  
✅ **Toxication Detection** – Detects signs of intoxication based on redness and eye openness  
✅ **Real-time Analysis** – Capture live images via webcam and get instant results  

Built using `OpenCV`, `MediaPipe`, `Tkinter`, and `NumPy`, this tool provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing facial health.
